              Recently, Google announced a<button id="hl-update" class="highlight">
                new, updated and refreshed</button
              >Material Design at Google I/O. In material.io they define it as a
              visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good
              design with the innovation of technology and science.
            </p>
            <p>
              There we can find a list of formal and functionalgeneric
              guidelines to embody most of our digital interface designs.
              Material Design is presented as a<button
                id="hl-universal"
                class="highlight"
              >
                universal and neutral language</button
              >a that every designer and developer should put into practice.
            </p>

            <h3>Materialism is the new Modernism?</h3>

            <p>
              In design history, the idea of universality and neutrality comes
              from the Modernism movement -
              <button id="hl-swiss" class="highlight">or Swiss Style</button> -
              which, one could suppose, is what Google means by “good classic
              design”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modernism appears after the carnage of the First World War and it
              was built from a utopian desire of achieving a universal language
              that would sustain harmonious communication between all nations.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we take a look at Material Design we can see that it's clearly
              influenced by the aesthetics and the ideology of Modernism. So
              much that it shares the same condescending attitude, as Google
              usually tells everyone what the best way to do things is and
              provides the tools to reproduce it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything is very well documented and, with an “open source”
              rhetoric, they ensure that everyone practices their guidelines.
              And that can be a problem.
            </p>

            <h4>Pure and neutral aesthetics</h4>

            <p>
              When only one perspective dominates the discourse of what
              constitutes good design, the doors to many other different
              aesthetics are closed. All the different forms, colors, typography
              and other elements are filled with meaning and have deep cultural
              impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea of a neutral “pure” aesthetic is a myth. That’s why, for
              instance, the western culture can't recognize the Nazi swastika as
              a simple form. It’s a taboo in the history of graphic design
              because it represents sociocultural problems, the Second World War
              and the Holocaust.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a similar way, when we make use of Material Design as an
              aesthetic for our interface designs, we are not just making a
              cosmetic choice. It's also a political choice.
            </p>
            <p>We are representing Google, whatever that might mean.</p>
            <p>
              Google is a multinational corporation that represents a particular
              culture and Material Design is just another tentacle of the
              octopus that monopolizes the Web.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s why, more than ever, movements like <button id="hl-brutal" class="highlight">Web-Brutalism</button> that have
              the boldness and the courage to question those “rational
              aesthetics”, dictated by science and technology, are very
              relevant.
            </p>
            <p>It reminds me of the Postmodernism era.</p>
            <p>
              Postmodernism: rejecting the formal organization Postmodernism is
              a broad movement that began in the 70’s and it was a drastic break
              from the modernists utopian visions. With an attitude of
              skepticism and irony, they completely rejected the rational order
              and formal organization.
            </p>
            <p>No more rules!</p>
            <p>
              If for modernists form should follow functions, for
              post-modernists, form is the function.
            </p>
            <p>
              We need to let ourselves be inspired by this kind of movements and
              other tendencies of graphic design outside of the western culture.
              Difference and opposition are essential to run a democratic and
              inclusive web.
            </p>
            <p>
              We should stop using frameworks like Material Design and
              Bootstrap.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori
              aesthetics.
            </p>
            <p>
              The aesthetic should be the result of your user's needs and
              business goals.
            </p>
            <h4>Learning from graphic design</h4>
            <p>
              It's a fact that when the time comes to build digital products for
              specific clients, it's a risk to think outside of the box, as we
              fear to lack on the user experience. However, the real challenge
              is to design the same mental models with different forms. We can
              innovate and still respect the web standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays, with tools like CSS Grid and Flexbox, we have more
              possibilities to rethink layouts and what they can be, as we did
              in the past with Post-Modernism or Deconstructivism.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jen Simons and Rachel Andrews have been doing a great job showing
              us how easy it can be and what we can do. Take the chance to check
              some of Jen's experiments at labs.jensimmons.com and get to know
              her great work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our users are becoming smarter than ever, owning a vast digital
              culture. They are open and I would even say that they want
              interfaces that both challenge them and trigger curiosity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The evolution that graphic design faced through its history should
              not be ignored when embracing web design, as the lack of critical
              thinking will make us repeat the same mistakes over and over
              again.

            Ribeiro makes a synonymous connection between the Modernism movement
            and Swiss Style. While the Swiss Style was an expression of
            Modernism that held great influence on the movement, a distinction
            should be made considering the excess of Modernist expressions that
            held little to no connections to the Swiss.
